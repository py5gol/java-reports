# java-reports
A web tool to manage and execute reports based on the Jasper Reports library

This is a tool that I've been using in my personal and professional projects for awhile. It does what it is expected but there are potential to lots of improvement. Some pieces doesn't work anymore and I didn't have time to fixit it, so I'm making the source code public and hopefully others might want to engage and help keeping this tool alive.

Cheers
